    To generate the API you have two different possibilities:
    * download the openapi.yaml file directly via the "export" button at the top of the page and generate the API in your project via a plugin
    * use Extensions in your IDE and connect directly to the service: https://api.stoplight.io/projects/cHJqOjIwMTI4Nw/branches/v3/export/reference/openapi.yaml

    The API is capable of processing the complete lifecycle of the
    following entity types:
    * `Freight Offers`
    * `Vehicle Space Offers`
    * `Freight Quotes`

    Specifically, the API can be used to carry out the following actions:
    * Create, delete and modify `Freight Offers`
    * Create, delete and modify `Vehicle Space Offers`
    * Retrieve offer detail information from foreign offers
    * Allows to negotiate conditions of received freight quotes

        Certain elements of the request contain errors. For instance, a value may exceed the allowed range for an element, or a mandatory element might be absent. Consequently, the API will report an error status in its response.

        Despite these issues, the request was successfully processed (and as a result of the processing, the API told you what is wrong in the request). It is up to you what you will do with this information. Perhaps you will give some feedback to the user and point out which part of the data he just entered caused the error.

      title: Closed Freight Exchange Setting
      description: |-
        The Closed Freight Exchange (briefly CFE, or in German: Geschlossene Frachtenbörse) is a concept of grouping TIMOCOM customers for offer publication constraints purposes. The common use case is that an offer with CFE settings will be published exclusively within the CFE in the first place. This means that it is not visible to any TIMOCOM customer which is not member of the set CFE. After a set duration of time (maybe never) it will be automatically visible to all TIMOCOM customers unless it has not been withdrawn before.

        If your company has a valid CFE contract with TIMOCOM you are able to send via the API all Closed Freight Exchange settings with the submitted offer.

            of the update timestamp.
            Timestamp of the first (of possibly multiple)
            request(s) with these filter
            parameters, necessary for
            proper pagination. I.e. if you want to have consistent
            data for multiple pagination requests you should keep
            this value (along with the lower bound) fix.
            A value more than 8 hours in the
            past will be rejected (status

        The Closed Freight Exchange (briefly CFE, or in German: Geschlossene Frachtenbörse) is a concept of grouping TIMOCOM customers for offer publication constraints purposes. The common use case is that an offer with CFE settings will be published exclusively within the CFE in the first place. This means that it is not visible to any TIMOCOM customer which is not member of the set CFE. After a set duration of time (maybe never) it will be automatically visible to all TIMOCOM customers unless it has not been withdrawn before.

        If your company has a valid CFE contract with TIMOCOM you are able to query for all CFE your TIMOCOM ID is part of.
